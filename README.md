## Introduction
- Leveraging NEO4J, we aim to revolutionize higher education by offering tailored university recommendations, unlocking every student's potential for a transformative educational future.
- Traditional university recommendation systems, often static and one-size-fits-all, fail to meet individual student needs and aspirations.
- NEO4J's graph database reimagines higher education by enabling highly personalized, context-aware university recommendations, transforming the educational landscape.

## Recommendation systems
- Handling Complex Relationships
- Dynamic and Real-Time
- Personalized Recommendations
- Visualizing Recommendations
- Data Accuracy and Completeness

## Why Neo4j?
- Graph Database Architecture
- Flexible Query Language (Cypher)
- Performance Advantage (efficient traversal & graph algorithms)
- Intuitive Data Model
- Compatibility with Python

## Model - K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
In the context of recommendation, KNN leverages the idea that users who have similar preferences for items are likely to have similar preferences for new items. The algorithm identifies a specified number (k) of users who are most similar to the target user and recommends items liked by those users.
